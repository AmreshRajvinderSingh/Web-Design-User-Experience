# Web Development Assignment 4

This assignment focuses on implementing form validations, dynamic form elements, and displaying results in an HTML table. Below are the detailed requirements:

1. **Form Validations:**
    a. Fields must not be null.
    b. Implement minimum length validation.
    c. Implement maximum length validation.
    d. Fields with alphanumeric values should not accept special characters.

2. **Submit Button:**
    - The submit button should be disabled until all validations on the fields are passed.

3. **Regex Validation:**
    - Use regex to validate phone number, email, and zip code.

4. **Visual Feedback:**
    - Validation errors should be displayed in red text along with each field.
    - The error messages should disappear upon correcting the respective fields.

5. **Event Handling:**
    - Validation should be triggered on key events, not just at the end when the submit button is pressed.

6. **Single Select List Box:**
    - Create a single select list box with 5 elements.

7. **OnChange Event:**
    - Write an onChange event for the list box that dynamically adds checkboxes for each selection.

8. **Checkbox and Text Field:**
    - If the checkbox is enabled, add a text field and make it mandatory.
    - On disabling the checkbox, the text field should disappear.

9. **HTML Table:**
    - On submit, create an HTML table that takes all the data from the previously submitted form and display the results.

10. **Form Reset:**
    - On submit, ensure all form fields get cleared out.

11. **Email Validation:**
    - Add validation for the email address, restricting the domain to @northeastern.edu.
